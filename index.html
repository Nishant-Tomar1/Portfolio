            <h2>Hello There! . . I'm Nishant Tomar, a member of Web and Design Society of IIT Bhubaneswar</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Nishant tomar, currectly an undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar. I am interested in coding, especially in web development which indeed is a great field to explore and learn. I used to get amazed how web works and how different webpages are linked and designed to make a website look modern. I am currently learning CSS along with JavaScript to learn to create these amazing and interactive websites. Currently I am involded in several extra academic activies while being a part to two technical societies (WebnD and Nakshatra) at IIT Bhubaneswar. The WeBnd socity provides excellent gudance and resources to improve my skills in web development.
            In the upcoming one year, I am expecting myself to get a better grip over JavaScript while learning some new extensions like Node Js and React.

            <h2>My Education and Professional career</h2>
            <p class="text4">I was born and brought up in Ghaziabad (Uttar Pradesh). I completed my schooling from a local school in Ghaziabad and thereafter started preparing for Joint Entrance Exam and finally got admission at IIT Bhubaneswar. Currently I am an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at IIT Bhubaneswar. Apart from academics, I am a tech enhusiast from my school days itself and hence got highly interested in coding (specially Web development). I am also a part of WebnD team at Alma Fiesta( the socio-cultural fest of IIT Bhubaneswar). I beleive I can grab difficult things more faster than others and beleive to become a full stack developer in upcoming years.
            Currently I know two programming languages (Python and C), a database language( MySQL ) and HTML, CSS along with Javascript as a Web developer.
            I am a quick learner and can learn new things to adapt to different working environments.
